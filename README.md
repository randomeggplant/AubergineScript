- **how do I  install PlainScript?**
you can install it through this github repository or do it like so:
1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).
2. After that, open the platform you use to code(if you don't have it, I'd recommend about [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and this is what I'm using here)
3. Then, open a folder:![open  folder](https://github.com/randomeggplant/MyPrivateRepo/blob/main/screenshot.png)
4. Then click on the three dots in the top of your screen, then click on "terminal", and then choose "New Terminal", that opens a new terminal in Visual Studio Code. Then type inside `npm install auberginescript`.
